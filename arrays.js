// As you may know, an anagram is a new word created by reorganizing all the letters in a word.
// This list of anagrams are all based on the word "Stop"
let anagrams = ["plots", "post", "stop", "puts", "tops"]

// Run this program after you try each step and see if it worked. (At the very bottom is a line of code that prints out the array. Use that to check your progress.)

// 1. Print out (log to the console) the third word in the array using bracket notation.





// 2. The word "opts" is also an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to add "opts" to the end of the array.





// 3. The word "puts", on the other hand, is not an anagram of the word "stop". Find a way to replace it with the word "pots".





// 4. Use the documentation to figure out what the methods ".shift()" and ".pop()" do.
//   Which one would best help us remove the word "plots" (which isn't a correct anagram of "stop") from our list?





// 5. Put the final list of anagrams in alphabetical order, and SAVE it.
// (If you encounter an error here, it's probably because your script is sorting it temporarily, but then immediately restoring it to the original order.)






// LEVEL 2: At this point, the tasks will get more challenging, because you'll work with datasets too large to handle by just looking at it and reading it.
// The arrays used in the second half of this lab will be stored in a neighboring file called "other_arrays.js".

// You can copy them over to this file directly as you need them.




// 6. The first array is an array called "fortunes" which is a list of fortune-cookie style fortunes. Print out a random fortune from the list.





// 7. This list is huge, so it'd be helpful to know how many fortunes are listed. Find a way to print out the number of fortunes in the list.





// 8. Challenge: Out of all the fotunes that are there, it'd mess up the program if some were listed twice, but with a list that big, it could happen.
//Find a way to check and see whether any of the fortunes are duplicates. If so, find a way to delete those duplicates.
